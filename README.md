# exercise-pizza
Trying to make pizzas only with CSS and HTML. The more CSS, the less HTML.

So far, juste a floating pizza with tomato sauce. I added a shadow to make it more realistic.

WIP:
- Add ingredients thanks to ``radial-gradient(circle at 10% 70%, #000000 0px 15px, transparent 15px 17px)``
- Hover effect with steam effect, or something close

I might add an italian pizza√Øolo but it could quite hard without an external link/picture.
