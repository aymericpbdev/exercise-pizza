# exercise-pizza
Trying to make pizzas only with CSS and HTML. The more CSS, the less HTML.

So far, just a floating pizza with tomato sauce. I added a shadow to make it more realistic.

WIP:
- Hover effect with steam effect, or something close
- Add some consistance to pizza, looks too flat for now

I might add an italian pizza√Øolo but it could quite hard without an external link/picture.
